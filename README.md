# project_zomboid_bot
Discord bot for managing your PZ server. 

I will not go into how to setup a bot or a service for a python script here, there are tons of guides already

# Requirements and Setup
Make sure you have python3-pip

This requires the rcon executable in the same directory as the script

https://leviwheatcroft.github.io/selfhosted-awesome-unlist/rcon-cli.html

```pip install rcon python-dotenv discord.py```

Make sure your PZ rcon server is listening on 27015

Create a .env file in the same directory as the pzbot.py file
```
RCON_PASS=SuperPassword
RCON_SERVER=127.0.0.1
RCON_PORT=27015
DISCORD_GUILD="My Discord Server"
DISCORD_TOKEN=CoolTokenHere
ADMIN_ROLES="Admin, Moderator"
LOG_PATH="/home/steamd/Zomboid/Logs"
```
LOG_PATH should point to where the PZ server logs root is. This is how the player deaths are reported.
ADMIN_ROLES are the discord server roles that will allow those users to run 'AdminCommands'

Start the bot script
